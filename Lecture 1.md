# Genocide
- War crime
- Terrorism
- Crimes of Aggression
- Crimes against humanity
- Straight up destroying peoples 
- Genocide became something coming into the 19th century was because the violence of war went far beyond the combatants on the battlefield. Civilians became more targeted. And with industrialization war became more lethal. 
- Its not that civilians did not get targeted but more so because in general it became more common to happen
- Shared Humanity also grew international laws were made to finally redraw a line between civilian and soldier. 


# Shared Humanity
- Started in 19th century
- From industrialization and secularization
- Englightenment period
- All people having shared humanity from French Revolution
- Church and other groups did not like the whole things because it removed aristocracies privilege and church's privilege. 
- Alot of stories go from those who believe in shared humanity and those who do not.

- Most of this shared humanity for alot of history was just for white men who had some level of education.

- Spread alot through Europe through revolution. 
- Industrialization brought a lot of the power of religion and aristocracy. 
- Nation state model brought came from this.

### Shared Humanity is still unanswered and unresolved

## Raphael Lemkin Guy who made the League of Nations
- Met in Madrid to form the League of Nations to decide international law. 
- Was meant to prevent another world war and that it was necessary to the world.
- Germany Left because Hitler took over 
- "Acts carried out against an individual as a member of collectivity, the goal being not only to harm individual but also the collectivity to which individual belongs" (Barbarism)
- Such a Crime undermined the fundamental basis of the social order
- Significant damage to social and cultural life produced by these collectivities (vandalism)
- He wanted to move beyond state law supremacy and make it so there are actual consequences for these types of crimes.
- Such crimes had to be prevented and punished.

## Winston Churchill talk (1941)
- TLDR is Nazi's are massacring whole districts, and executing thousands in cold blood.
- "We are in the presence of a crime without a name"
- Before Nazi Death camps were set up yet
- Nazi's used law to legitimize the murder of peoples

## Lemkin defines Genocide
- Genos + cide
- includes both physical murder and deprivation of basic human rights.
- Expanded on crimes against humanity
- Victims targeted because of who they were - this is what made genocide an international crime, because any human can potentially become a victim.
- Doesn't always mean killing people or the physical. Killing culture is equally qualifying. 
- Can be non-war related. 

## International Military tribunal at Nuremberg
- Setting a international legal precendent for Genocide
- Against the Nazi's
- Some did not want to do the trial to do it because it would give some the precedent to be able to convict the bombing of Germany that killed thousands of German civilians
- If the persecution of Jews was only in Germany this tribunal would not work. As it would not be "International"


## United Nations
- Term Coined in 1942 by Franklin D. Roosevelt
- Charter adopted in April 1945 in San Francisco
- Important precursor events: International Telecommunication Union, Universal Postal Union
- First 2 international peace conferences at the hague, which complemented development of the internatial law at Gevenea Conventions, League of Nations

- Panama and many other smaller countries that had histories of being colonized were very happy with it and getting this version of Genocide
- Genocide was an international crime and it would be punished
- Israel, US, Russia do not respect their power

## Success of the United Nations Convention (ICC)
- Genocide is not just a war time crime and could happen in a time of peace. 
- Crime would be extraditable
- Went beyond mass murder and included "intent to destroy, in whole or in part"
- Signatory nations obliged to try genocidal criminals either at home or in international tribunal 
- Signatory nations called upon to prevent and suppress acts of genocide.


## 5 Parts of Genocide to make something a genocide
1. Extent to which intentional group annihilation is the core
2. Conceptualization of intent
3. Mode of annihiliation is defined
4. How agent of annihilation is defined
5. How victim of annihilation is defined

### But this is frustrating in the UN definition
- Intent hard to prove
- Mode of annihilation is detailed and extensive but soft
- Agent of annihilation is not defined at all (soft)
- Victim of annihilation is limited to membership in one of the following groups, national, ethnical, religious, or racial group. (hard)
- Both to narrow and to broad

### Does it have to be a state to commit a Genocide?
- Definition does not define if it has to be a state or not
- as long as intent and annihilation occur. It is ball.
