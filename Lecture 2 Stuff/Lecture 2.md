- All cases of Antisemitism

## Hitler and Nazism
- Their was a hate of race mixing

- "We don't stand alone"
- Many Countries all had these laws

## The T4 Program (Aktion)
- "Life Unworthy of Living"
- Elimininating those that cannot contribute to Germany's Purety
- Killed thousands of people
- Parents consent was not required nor guardian
- Handicapped children to then adults
- Moved from asylums and mental hospitals and just killed all of them. 
- Called a "Euthanasia Program"
- Run by the hospitals and many medical professionals
- Obviously the Church was not super down.
- Hitler officially canceled the program because of the Church 
- Unofficially the program was still running 
- Killed with poison injections first, and then used gas in mobile gas vents inside a van. Made to house tons of people to kill as many people. Optimization of murder. 
- Most of the time the family and guardians did not find out until well after and never told how they died
- Klemens von Gallen is a Catholic bishop and was the man who talked against it.

- Lots of Nazi people in power wanted to just kill him, but he was super popular and by this point nobility still had a level of power. 


## 1939 Hitler Speech to Reichstag
- Nazi party only allowed party
- Basically Hitler was saying that the Jewish financiers to start another World War for Bolshevizing (Community). But it would not result in Jewish win but the annihilation of the Jewish people 

## Poland at this point

- Poland was functionally an experiment in colonization
- Many suffered greatly in labor camps, starved, beaten to death, for sport, etc.
- Many camps here did different things, they used them for label, killed them etc. of Jews
- Extermination was not official yet though. Still they were trying to decide to use for free labor or not.

## Operation Reinhard


## Death Camps by Numbers
- Reinhard camps killed 1.5 million Jews

## Hitler Still Blamed the Jews for everything
- Germany ended up in ruin.

## Justice after Genocide
- What punishment fits the crime?
- Execution? Life Imprisonment? Rehabilitation? 
- Usually it's the Victor that is the judge and the loser are evil.
- The guy who bombed Japan would have been a war criminal if they lost and is a hero now. 
- Justice is tricky here.
