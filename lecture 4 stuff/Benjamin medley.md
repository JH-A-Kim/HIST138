# Summary of Benjamin Madley’s Assessment of the Yuki Genocide

Benjamin Madley argues that the catastrophic decline of the Yuki Indian population between 1854 and 1864 was a case of genocide sanctioned by the State of California and enabled by federal neglect. He challenges the traditional historical narrative that disease was the primary cause of Native American depopulation, showing instead that the Yuki were victims of a deliberate campaign of extermination

## Defining Genocide via the 1948 UN Convention

Madley uses the 1948 United Nations Genocide Convention as an internationally recognized rubric to evaluate the Yuki case.


- Intent vs. Motive: He clarifies that "specific intent" to destroy a group does not require a specific motive like racial hatred; it can be driven by military, economic, or territorial goals.


- Genocidal Acts: The article demonstrates that perpetrators committed all five acts defined by the convention: killing, causing bodily/mental harm, inflicting destructive conditions of life, preventing births, and transferring children .


- Perpetrator Responsibility: Madley asserts that while vigilantes did much of the killing, state and federal officials are culpable because they knew their actions would lead to the group's destruction

## State-Sponsored Militia Campaigns

The genocide transitioned from informal settler violence to organized, state-funded military operations.


The Eel River Rangers: In 1859, Governor John Weller commissioned Walter S. Jarboe and his "Rangers" to hunt the Yuki outside the reservation.


Indiscriminate Slaughter: Jarboe reported killing 283 "Warriors," but reports from federal agents and army officers confirmed that the Rangers slaughtered men, women, and children indiscriminately.


Legislative Sanction: Despite public criticism of the "Mendocino War," the California Legislature appropriated $9,347.39 to pay Jarboe for his campaign.


Frequency of Attacks: Settler Dryden Lacock testified that expeditions averaged 50 to 60 kills per trip, with some weeks requiring two or three outings.

## Legalized Kidnapping and Servitude

State laws created a legal framework for the abduction of Yuki people, which served both as a labor source and a tool for cultural destruction.


The 1850 Act: The "Act for the Government and Protection of Indians" allowed whites to take custody of Indian minors and lease "vagrant" Indians as unpaid laborers.


Expansion of Involuntary Servitude: In 1860, the law was expanded to include "indenture" of any Indian, including prisoners of war, and raised the age of service for males to 25 .


Commercial Abduction: Explorers like Pierce Asbill kidnapped at least 35 Yuki women and girls in 1855 to trade for horses.


Demographic Impact: These abductions separated men and women during peak reproductive years, accelerating the population's decline.

## Neglect and Mortality on the Reservation

For the Yuki forced onto the Round Valley Reservation, conditions were often lethal due to willful official neglect.


Starvation Rations: By 1862, daily rations for reservation Indians fell to just two or three ears of corn, or roughly 160 to 390 calories per person.


Comparison to Slavery: Madley notes that while the average free American in 1860 consumed 3,741 calories and an enslaved person received 4,185, Yuki Indians were frequently given less than 1,000 calories.


Lethal Labor: Reservation employees forced Yuki to work as "packers," carrying 50-pound loads through mountain snow and mud while nearly naked, leading to hundreds of deaths .


Embezzlement: Superintendent Thomas Henley and his subordinates were found to have embezzled funds meant for Indian rations and used reservation land for their own private cattle.

## Challenging the "Disease" Thesis

Madley argues that the Yuki case contradicts the theory that disease was the primary driver of population decline in California.


Lack of Epidemics: There is no evidence of lethal "Old World" epidemics among the Yuki between 1854 and 1864.


Human Agency: The 90% decline in the Yuki population was driven by human actions: murder, exposure, and starvation.
