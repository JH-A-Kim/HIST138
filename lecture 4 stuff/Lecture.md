- And also not using the land sufficiently

## Colonialism + Settler Colonialism

## Colonizing Turtle Island

- Turtle Island is the continent of North America
- Took place across 5 centuries 
- Affected millions of Indigenous peoples
- Accomplished by multiple kinds of perpetrators
- Invovled intricate combination of intentional/accidental, direct/indirect methods with broadly similar, compatible or complementary aims: subordination, dispossesion, removal, elimination, extinction of Indigenous peoples. 


## Genocide in Colonial Australia

- Sheer physical remoteness from home country
- Inhospitable topography and climate
- threat of starvation was ever present
- Colony was initially a safety valve for Britain's bursting slum and criminal population
- As a penal colony Australia featured three kinds of whites: the convicts, the colonial administration, the free settlers who came later.
- Pervasive culture of terror

## Van Diemens's Land

- Small but strategic Island by Australia (Tasmania)
- Densely forested and 4 distinct seasons
- many people became bushrangers (bandits) (would attack white settlers and aboriginals)
- Bushrangers were the first group to properly threaten the aborigienes. 
- By 1824 only 1500 of maybe 4 to 5 thouseand aborigines were still alive.
- no one was convicted for killing aborigines

## The Black War

- Indigenous peoples start fighting back against the White people in response to the wanton rape, abduction and dispossesion.
- They were called as the "blacks"
- Tasmanians Indigenous peoples were hunted and killed like beasts
- Governeor George Arthur amered militias and encouveraged settlers to organize in self-defense
- Soldiers and settlers engaged in "black hunts"
- genocidal policy was framed as humanitarian.
- Capture, remove, and kill all Indigenous peoples as only way to make Tasmania safe. (and "for their own safety")
- 1830 the "Black Line" 
- over the next 2 decades 5 out of 6 died due to exposure ("institutional malnutrition"), lack of provisions, and homesickness
- Eventually 47 aborigines were relocated back to Tasmania, almost too little to late.

## Tasmania: Clearly Genocide

- Multiple perpetrators on record articulate an intent to destroy in whole or in part
- Committed at least 4 acts elaborated in article 2
- They killed
- They raped and assauleted which constituted serious bodily harm
- deliberately infliced conditions designed to destry by incarcerating aborigines on flinders and making no attempt to ensure their survival there.
- they abducted children.

- "Brought" Christianity to Indigenous peoples.
- Intended to "Civilize" the Indigenous peoples by putting them into hard labour 
- Domestication of Indigenous people

## Timeline

- mid to late 19th century sees a shift in attitudes towards California's Indigenous population.
- Indians as valuable labour
- Indians as targets of domestication
- Indians as victims of extermination.
- During gold rush where they needed cheap labor.
1846 and 1848

Indians could not be used as witnesses against White people which made it so Indians could not defend themselves at all


- 1848 had 13,000 Indigenous peoples
- 1860 had 100s of thousands of Indigenous peoples.
- Arrival of 49ers people drawn to find Gold and making it rich. These men brought their particular ideas of Indigenous peoples where they had gotten used to expelling Indigenous people. 
- Reserves were created to throw all these Indigenous peoples. 
- Relinquish their rights to their regular land and they would be "Domesticated" on these reserves. All a ploy to get more land by white people. 
- Many White people wanted to "Kill" the Indian problem. Holy God complex.

## California: Perpetrators, Victims, Bystanders

- Commissioners advocated domestication.
- Governors opposing commissioners work
- California Legislature, US Senate
- Gold-Rush Prospectors
- White Californian Settlers
- White Militias

## Is there a way to tell the story that returns agency to Indians

- Yuki Indians in California from 10s of thousands to hundreds.
- Basically slaughtered, enslaved, and destroyed by White Settlers.
- Both organized killing and non-organized killing.
- "The Act for the Government and Protection of Indians" - abduct, employ, basically enslave Yuki Indian peoples is the point of it. 
- Other legislature made was so Yuki Indians were not allowed to own any firearms
- Just enslaved and subjected to malnutrition.


## Yana Indians

- Destroyed from 3000 to maybe a dozen
- Yana only had 3 choices

1. Submit for their own protection
2. Fight
3. Retreat to the mountains

- Thefts and or raids of property and cattle always blamed on Yana.
- Through 1860's forced removal and ethnic cleansing went hand in hand with physical extermination.
