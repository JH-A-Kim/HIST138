# Notes

Land is a contest for life!

## Logic of elimination

## Settle Colonialism is inherently eliminatory but not invariably genocidal

## Settler Colonialism is a structure not an event. (Destroys to replace)
- Colonialism is not just the initial moment of invasion or "frontier homicide"
- It is a structure because it is something that is ongoing to try and remove the native presence. This structure that is created exists long after the frontier is closed.

## Logic of Elimination
- Primary motivation of settler colonialism is access to territory. Dissolve society to gain access to land. 
- 2 Purposes
1. Negative: aims to dissolve native societies
2. "Positive": it erects and builds things new structures, a new settler society. Destroys the old to build the new. Invasion does not stop because the settlers continue to stay and live in the invaded location. Settler colonialism is a structure. Violence becomes a permanent society.

- Example If some village is invaded and leaves that is an event if an army invades and then builds their own new town on top with new laws and ideas and people that is a structure

- Wolfe lists a few ways that they eliminate the native societies 
1. Have settlers and natives to mix and have kids to breed out the native bloodlines
2. Making the native land become collective land to private land mmm capitalism
3. Making indigenous peoples citizens of the settler nation to remove their identity
4. Child abduction for residential schools to "Beat the Indian out of them", "Kill the Indian to save the man"


## Settler Colonialism vs Genocide
- Structural Genocide is the definition of settler colonialism where we do not just kill the person but kill their identity with structures
- Avoids the whole levels of killing argument

## Race, Land, Labor
- Native Americans (land) were racialized because they obstructed access to land. Basically to get in the way all they had to do is be at home.
- African Americans (Labor) were racialized to be exploited for labor. 
- Assimilation: Did not need the Indians so erase them and their identity, but kept the African American identity to keep them as labor.

## Some Case Studies and Examples
- US Frontier: Removal of Cherokee and "Trail of Tears" was a "Civilized" farming community removed because settlers wanted land
- Israel/Palestine: Logic of Elimination on Zionism to replace native society.
- Australia: "Tide of History" legal argument used to remove native title and the practice of abducting Aboriginal Children. Way to eliminate intended to prevent births within the group 

## One Drop Rule
- A slave's child becomes a slave themselves 
- No matter to what degree of their ancestry of being African they are Black. 
- In contrast Indian children with non-Indian is a "Half Breed" and does not matter. 

## Justification for removing Aboriginal people was that we could use the land better (wtf)
