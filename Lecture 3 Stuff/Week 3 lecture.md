## Imperialism
- One nations influcence on another a power relationship
- TRC acquiring and maintaining an empire
- American Imperialism is not about just taking over but more invisible power

## Colonialism
- One nations practice of deriving certain benefits from another usually via conlonies or settlements
- TRC transforming acquired territories into a colony usually via settlers 
- Actually transforming the nation

## Settler Colonialism



## Nazi's and the Jews
- Jews were considered colonisers onto German land
- Considered them to be dirty, lazy, uncivilized etc.
- Considered racially subhuman
- By July 1941, murder of Jewish peoples 
- Wartime labor shortages in Germany was resulted through foreign workers ie slave labor
- 20% of German workforce was made up of foreign workers
- thats 15 million people

Lots of malnutrition, murder, etc

- 2000 German Companies benefited from this forced labor


## Settler Colonialism
Has no widely agreed on definition but does have certain characteristics
1. Focus on acquisition of land via settlement "Land is life"
2. Settlers can be but ar not always from home country
3. Settlers typically interfere with pre-existing/indigeuous groups
4. Coupled with beliefs in racial and cultureual superiority, settler-indigenous tensions, usually degenerate into violence
5. Typically lasts indefinity unless settlers are forced to evacuate
6. Inherently eliminationist but not necessarily always genocidal


## Settlers removal of indigenous peoples
- Would forcefully remove the indigenous peopls 
- The savage would destroy them
- Resulting in eliminationis policies

## Does the Canadian Example Legally qualify as a Genocide
- Physical destruction does not need to be the primary thing for Genocide
- Annihilation of culture is the staple of genocide
- Residential schools are the primary.

They did all of these things during the whole residential school shit
1. Killed members of the group
2. Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group
3. Deilberatily inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whiole or in part
4. Imposed measures intended to prevent births in the group
5. Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

So yeah I think it was a genocide "Kill the Indian in them" 
- Aimed at assimilating Indigenous people and destroy them as Aboriginals
- Yes it does in the legal context of UN definition

## Developments 
1. Oak Crisis, Meech Lake Accord
2. Royal commission of aboriginal peoples (1991)
3. Indian Residential Schools agreement (2006)
4. Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2008)
5. Truth and Reconciliation Commission Final Report (2015)

## Holy Catholicism destroying Indigenous children
- 1997 was the last one closed in Saskatchewan

## Aboriginal People
- Defined as First Nations, Metis, Inuit 
- Umbrella Term

## Residential Schools
- Staff were missionaries and nuns
- Bad Training
- The entire shit was super ass
- Neglect was institutionalized
- Was more just manual labor than any learning because they were considered to be intellectually and culturally inferior and many people those teachers primarily did not think that they could actually become "Civilized"

Holy Thomas Moore went from dripped to generic. Is Thomas even his actual name damn.

- Gobles of sexual abuse to the children
- Extinction discourse and settler colonialism


## Multi Faceted effect
