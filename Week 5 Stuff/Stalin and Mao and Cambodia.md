## Stalin and Mao

So much policy just to kill its own people in the Soviet Union.

But Mao's killed the most people.

### Starting with the Soviet Union and Stalinism.

kulak for the bourgeasie but that could even mean just owning a cow.

at least 10 million kulaks expelled from their homes and villages where 1.4 million were literally sent to the Gulag. 

Often sent to remote and inhospitable northern regions so Stalins regime could open up mineral and timber rich north. Free labour ahh. 

15% mortality rate on that shit. 

They then heavily taxed the shit out of the people often more thn what they could ever produce. They said they would export food like the British to support other famines they too would stockpile food for other peoepl even though they were actively experiencing massive famine.

They were exporting 1.8 million tons of cereal to honor debts to Germany and buy foreign machinery.

He thought famine was just natural course of developing and he refused to accept any outside assistance.

As the famine continued, those that were alive attracted suspicion because that meant they had food. But if they had food they should have given it up. That meant they were enemies.

All this death was hidden by expunging data from village records. An estimate of the deaths was 5.7 million. This killing by hunger is called the Holdomor or hunger extermination. This was mostly ethnic Ukrainians. 1.45 million Kazakhastan people also died during this time.

### Gulag

Kulaks and other class enemies put in this vast slave labor network. 2.4 million inmates by 1936.

They were sent to get gold or timber in Siberia. And apart from dying from the environment they would also be subjected to NKVD execution squads who would pronounc you dead on a whim.

For the people of the death camps in the Arctic Circle their is a big argument for Genocidal Intent as they were often depicted as Subhuman or of the most dangerous enemies. The main goal of the Soviet Labour camp system was to convert lives for gold and timber that could be traded. 

Although the only problem is conditions varied greatly between labour camps. Camp Commanders who impeded the use of the labour would be sanctioned or dismissed if they killed to many.

### The Great Purge

The apex of the Gulags came after the second world war the leftover kulaks were branded as the primary ringleaders of all sorts of anti soviet and diversionary crimes. At this point the meaning of the name lost its socioeconomic meaning and was purely a political tool and could be changed to target any group Stalin wished. Such as ethnic groups. Particularly Polish people.

In these years of terror any adult knew that even the slightest careless word or gesture could throw you into the abyss.

A time of great terror for literally every person. The only reason it stopped was because that at the rate of arrests everyone would have become implicated. And so the NKVD was purged and the leader Nikolai Yezhov was arrested and killed. 

Targeted the "Old Bolsheviks," the military high command (412 out of 767 executed), and "kulaks" in a second dekulakization campaign.

Tribunals known as troikas decided life or death in a minute or less, handling sixty cases per hour.


Core Themes and Ideologies

Classicide: The regime targeted specific social classes, particularly "kulaks" (better-off peasants), as "enemies of the people".


Rapid Industrialization: To achieve "socialism in one country," Stalin imposed hysterically rapid industrialization, using the peasantry as an "internal colony" for resources.


Paranoia and Purges: Power was maintained through absolute control and the "cult of personality," where any perceived dissent resulted in death or incarceration.


During WWII, entire nations—including Chechens, Crimean Tatars, and Ingushi—were deported to desolate regions .

An estimated 78,000 Chechens died on transport trains alone.

Witness Account: Boris Izvekov
A renowned physicist and son of a priest, Izvekov was arrested in 1942 during the Siege of Leningrad. After being tortured into confessing to "German spying" and naming colleagues as traitors, he was executed in an NKVD cellar. His wife was also sent to the Gulag


II. China and Maoism (Pages 245–253)
Mao Zedong is identified as "the deadliest individual in history to have wreaked havoc inside a single country".

Key Themes

Peasant Revolution: Unlike the Soviets, Chinese communists viewed the peasantry as the core of the revolution.


Merciless Extermination: Ideology centered on a "thirst for the last drop of the enemy’s blood" to compensate for martyred comrades.


Public Humiliation: "Struggle sessions" involved making victims kneel on broken tiles or hanging them by their wrists while being mocked by crowds.

This comprehensive analysis covers the Stalinist and Maoist eras, as well as the Cambodian genocide under the Khmer Rouge, as detailed in the textbook Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction.

I. Stalin and the Soviet Union (Pages 222–245)
The Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin initiated policies designed to eliminate millions of its own citizens through direct execution, forced labor, and manipulated famines.

Key Events and Examples
Collectivization and the Holodomor:

In 1930, Stalin approved the "liquidation of kulaks as a class".

Between 1930 and 1933, approximately 5.7 million people died across the USSR due to state-induced famine.

In Ukraine, this is known as the Holodomor ("hunger-extermination"), claiming roughly 3.9 million lives.

In Kazakhstan, the famine was even more devastating proportionally, killing 1.45 million people.

The Gulag System:

A vast network of slave labor camps, often located in lethal Arctic conditions .

Camps like Kolyma are described as "extermination centers," where mortality rates for gold miners reached 30% per year.

The Great Purge (1937–1938):

Targeted the "Old Bolsheviks," the military high command (412 out of 767 executed), and "kulaks" in a second dekulakization campaign.

Tribunals known as troikas decided life or death in a minute or less, handling sixty cases per hour.

Destruction of National Minorities:

During WWII, entire nations—including Chechens, Crimean Tatars, and Ingushi—were deported to desolate regions .

An estimated 78,000 Chechens died on transport trains alone.

After Stalins death Gulag prisoners were realeased most that shit shut down and life got to come back. Interestingly thouhg many Russians still consider him to be one of the ten most outstanding figures of all times and nations. 

Witness Account: Boris Izvekov
A renowned physicist and son of a priest, Izvekov was arrested in 1942 during the Siege of Leningrad. After being tortured into confessing to "German spying" and naming colleagues as traitors, he was executed in an NKVD cellar. His wife was also sent to the Gulag.

II. China and Maoism (Pages 245–253)
Mao Zedong is identified as "the deadliest individual in history to have wreaked havoc inside a single country".

He would target "Bad Landlords" and commit indiscriminate violence against them and this could be very random. And this was often filled by quotas. And often accusations based on grudges and personal rivalries in the local communities. Mao even wrote in an essay called "The Question of going too far" that it is necessary to go to this degree or else they cannot overthrow the gentry.

Mao also had his own labor camps called the Lao Gai. Which was much the same as any other labor camp where class enemies were dispatched. The camps accounted for many the dead during his regime.

Mofo willing to sac 300 million chinese for victory of world revolution. Very willing to sacrifice people. 

The Great Leap Forward was a lie that there was so much food surplus but really everybody was starving to death. 40 million people died in just 3 years. In just one year 22 million people died. The total population loss during the great famine then comes to 76 million people that is broken down into 36 million people died unnatural deaths and a shortfall of 40 million births (expected births that did not happen)
Key Themes

Aid from other countries was refused 

Peasant Revolution: Unlike the Soviets, Chinese communists viewed the peasantry as the core of the revolution.


Merciless Extermination: Ideology centered on a "thirst for the last drop of the enemy’s blood" to compensate for martyred comrades.


Public Humiliation: "Struggle sessions" involved making victims kneel on broken tiles or hanging them by their wrists while being mocked by crowds.

III. Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge (Pages 334–356)
The Khmer Rouge (KR) regime (1975–1979) destroyed roughly one-quarter of Cambodia’s population—1.7 to 1.9 million people—in less than four years.

Genocidal Ideology

Xenophobia and Messianic Nationalism: A desire to reclaim the "lost" glory of the Angkor Empire and a paranoid hatred of the Vietnamese.

Urbicide: The rejection of cities as cesspools of corruption. Upon taking power in March 1975, the KR forcibly evacuated two million people from Phnom Penh into the countryside.


"Year Zero": The attempt to restart history by dismantling money, markets, religion, and the family unit .


Base People vs. New People: Rural peasants ("Base People") were favored, while former urbanites ("New People") were treated as subhuman "microbes" to be purged.

The Execution of Genocide

The Killing Fields: Mass executions were carried out to "dig up the roots" (exterminating entire families so no one could seek revenge).


Tuol Sleng (S-21): A high-school-turned-torture-center in Phnom Penh where an estimated 14,000 prisoners were held; only ten are known to have survived.


Gendercide: Specific targeting of adult males, particularly from the former military or professional classes.

Witness Account: Denise Affonço
A survivor of "the Widows’ Dike," Affonço witnessed the death of her daughter and sister-in-law from starvation . Her husband was taken for "re-education" and murdered . She survived by eating tadpoles, snails, and nutrient-rich rice husks, eventually testifying at the 1979 genocide trials

# Lecture Stuff

Stalin made sure class was not added into the description for genocides

There does not need a long term hate between groups. Often times victim groups are part of the same racial group

And is instead separated by class or political group.

For Stalin, Mao, and Khmer Rouge the goal was to "Improve Human Nature" Supposed progress but often just killings. Like Khmer Rouge (His "If we kill all the rich people then there is no bad people")

Remaking of society "Year Zero"

Economic Collapse and famine was used to kill using hunger as a weapon. 

## Marxist theory of History:

Nobility at the top

Industrial revolition would replace nobility by Bourgeuasie

Bourgeoisie overthrown by proletariat to take control of production.

Eradication of all classes creating largescale collectivization

End of Cycle Utopia

State is to be removed but not immediately to keep order.


### Quicksand Society because it is moving to fast and constant uncertainty it just makes everything unstable as shit.

Obsession with Quota-filling

Racial Communism.

Collectivazation took tons of people creating collectivized farms where they took everything and just killed anyone that did not have that revolutionary spirit type shit.

Paranoia is the defining trai between the 3 communist leaders

And purges happened to kill anyone that went out of line.

To justify his activities and red guard would just straight up destroy the entire country. Many chose to kill themselves and it was fucking horrible.

The killing fields
- Kill tree against which execurioners beat children


Everyone was supposed to become khmer and anyone that did not would be removed (killed)

Family became part of Race and if you had a family that meant you aint Khmer so gg. 

Holy jesus they just hated the Vietnamese. And Viets just came down on them and destroyed them.

by the end of the Khmer Rouge 
- 50-60% Vietnamese Killed
- 60% Chinese Killed
- 60% of Muslim Cham killed.


The Khmer Rouge Leaders managed to run away and so those people were considered the legitamte leader of Cambodia so they escaped alot of shit because of that.

Class and political identity they thought could not change so they had to be eliminated. Hard to determine for them if they killed because for politics or for class or for race. Wacky but ultimately they got merked.
