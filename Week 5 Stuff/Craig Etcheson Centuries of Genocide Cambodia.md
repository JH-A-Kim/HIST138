# Khmer Rouge Regime

This Genocide overall was a result of a few factors at play. A small group seeking power, Utopian Ideology, Historical Grievances, and a fractured society.

Prior to this Genocide Cambodia was seen as being in a "Golden Age" under Prince Sihanouk. On the other side there were growing tensions because of high taxes on farmers and the rise of the landless class that was exploited by the Khmer Rouge. (Massive Taxes, Merchant Class gauging people lowkey kinda a shit time.) Sihanouk Created killed a fuck ton of people and all of which being his rivals for power. He coined the term Khmer Rouge for Khmer Communists. He rooted them out and decimated them.

Because of war in Vietnam, Vietnamese people buying shit tons of rice to supply troops. This brought rice prices way up. And this added money was not going back to the farmers but the middlemen in-between. 

So rising prices as well as massive taxes was just cooking people. 

The rebellion started with just one attack on soldiers gathering taxes and just spread like wildfire. 

The Cambodian communists were like we piggy back on this and bam.

But this was ultimately small in nature what really done the prince in was the growing economic crisis and elites discontent with him so a coup started and ended him. 

Holy Massive US influence though so much money pumped into the Lon Nol Regime. 

Because of this Sihanouk allied with the Khmer rouge to avenge his overthrow. And because peasants considered him a God when he said to join the communists they in fact did. Same with the communist allies of North Vietnam and other places because the Lon Nol Regime was against the communists.

The Khmer Rouge would take towns not hold it sort the people into enemy and regular person and would just kill the shit out of enemies and place the regular people to work.

Khmer Rouge had this idea that they wanted to transform human nature and achieve communism by skipping all the intermediate historical stages of development.

"Year Zero" after they achieved power in April 17th, 1975. They started trying to entirely rebuild Cambodia ground up.

## The Totalitarian Slave State

This time under Pol Pot was described as a slave state where 25% of the population died 2 to 2.4 million people.

The regime got rid of money, markets, private property, religion, modern medicine, and even traditional family structures. (Modern medicine was allowed for the top people though)

They figured that by getting rid of the not poor people who were ethnic Khmer peasants, bingo bango banzai ahh they get rid of the rich and suddenly everyone is equal. (15% not poor)

Power in this regime was governed under a branching structure of committees and security offices. Most infamous of which was S-21 (Tuol Sleng) in Phnom Penh.

"Smash" Protocol was where prisoners were tortured until they confessed to being enemies and name co-conspirators leading to tons of executives and arrests. 1.1 million people killed by this

## What was targeted?

Multiple Genocides occurred but the tldr of it was:

### Vietnamese

Nearly all Vietnamese people in Cambodia, hunted and killed or expelled by 1978 in Cambodia. This was because there was already a lot of historical animosity but the Khmer Rouge also thought that the Vietnamese Communists who had been there allies were trying to subvert their revolution and this was the greatest threat to their country. "1 against 30" slogan was if Cambodians all kill 30 Vietnamese people they can exterminate the Vietnamese

Literally all of them killed or removed from Cambodia.

### Cham (Muslim) People

Because they big on religion, regime wanted to get rid of that shit to achieve full uniformity. Between 35% - 40% of the Muslim people killed.

They resisted slightly against the Khmer Rouge and were promptly put down for their culture. Cham peoples were broken up and dispersed so they could not interact with other Cham. Forced to eat pork. Eventually was decided they could not become Khmer and leaders instructed to gather and then dispose of them.

### Khmer People

Majority of victims were ethnic Khmer, scholars debate whether this was genocide or crimes against humanity as the perpetrators were from the same group. 

## Aftermath

This whole ahh situation gets more complicated by cold war shit. Because Western powers and China continue to support the Khmer Rouge at the UN for over a decade after their 1979 ouster.

But Pol Pot was bitch slapped by the Vietnamese and sent home packing.

Ultimately this resulted in massive amounts of people lacking education, and ending up deeply scarred. 

In the last 20 years they have been rebuilding and many people returning. Also the Cham communities in Cambodia making a comeback. But with so many of the religious leaders being killed it makes it extremely hard to fully recover their traditions and culture and Muslim Missionaries are skewing things a little. Cham Community took a massive hit.

### KRT or Khmer Rouge Tribunal

Created in 2006 to try the senior leaders. But was difficult because the defendants were old, political interference, and complex procedural rules.

But ultimately ended up with the Chief of the S-21 being sentenced to life in prison. Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan being found guilty of Genocide and crimes against humanity

Was hard to set up international interference, and because they had no laws and created a whole new legal structure, breadth of allegatiions, and many of the suspects were already dead. And overall ended up being super complex.

And if the defendants died before the judgement then they would be considered innocent so the defense teams sought to delay the shit out of the whole process.

They would do things like try to disqualify judges, court administrators, etc. Anything to drag things out.

TLDR it took way to fucking long.

Genocide Justice is fucking long, hard, and complicated.

## Some Eye Witness Accounts

### Evacuation of Phnom Penh

Mony Pich describes the initial joy of thinking the war was over only to be forced out of the city at gunpoint hours later witnessing the abandonment of the elderly on the roadsides.

Then seperated into work groups to work fields and do work. Sometimes they would hit unexploded munitions and die.

### State mandated Marriage

Mony Pich also talks about being forced to marry a stranger in a mass ceremony of 86 pairs where brides and grooms did not even know what each other looked like.

### Noodle Soup Trick

Arun Sokhom explains how the Khmer Rouge would use euphemisms like being invited to eat noodle soup as a lure to take people away to be killed. 

### Internal Purge

Sam Srei a high ranking Khmer Rouge Female commander describes being arrested and accused of being a Vietnamese CIA spy by her own regime in 1977. 

## My observations

- Interesting the little disregard for human life but also how they show this level of "We are making our utopia" and were bringing down so many different structures like family, religion, property and medicine (but then when it comes to the top people they get to have medicine?) So shows a degree of hypocrisy. They clearly think that they are better even though their whole shtick is equality.

- It was also just intresting to see the lasting impacts on the Cham people where they lost so many of their religious leaders so a large component of their religion is just gone 

- Was also interesting to see that the lawyers are defending them and trying to make it so they get off as innocent by doing anything they can to remove the judges and just delay the whole process 

- And then the whole notion of state mandated marriages was just interesting 

- And then groups like the S-21 and the security offices just.
